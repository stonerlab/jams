// This config simulates a Bloch domain wall which is kept stable using pinned
// magnetisation boundaries. It is primarily and example of how to use the
// "bloch_domain_wall" initializer and "pinned_boundaries" physics module.
//
// With this config we can simulate Bloch domain walls at finite temperature to
// study their properties or infer the temperature (or magnetisation) dependence
// of the exchange stiffness.

// The "bloch_domain_wall" initializer and "pinned_boundaries" physics modules

// system along x without periodic boundaries. In the y and z directions we
// can use smaller dimensions and have periodic boundaries to reduce surface
// effects.

//  t_step = 1e-16;
//  t_max = 10e-9;

// Solve on the GPU. RK4 allows a much larger time step. It's still going to
// be slow because of the pinned boundaries (see notes below). We can also
// use the quantum thermostat ("langevin-bose-gpu") which is not implemented
// on the CPU.

// The domain wall width at zero temperature will be w = \sqrt{A/K} nanometers.
// in the initializer we must give the parameter in units of lattice constants,
// i.e. w/a = (1/a) \sqrt{A/K}. The conversion to J (Heisenberg exchange in JAMS
// 1/2 convention) and k (single ion anisotropy) using A = J/2a, K = k/a^3 is
// w/a = \sqrt{J / (2k)}. See Kazantseva, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 037206 (2005)
// (https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.94.037206) for the details of
// simulating Bloch walls.

};


// So stop the system relaxing to the ferromagnetic state we use pinned
// boundaries. This means the magnetisation at each end of the x-direction is
// held in a fixed direction by a rotation of the spins every time step. We hold
// the left side magnetisation in the -z direction and the right size in the +z
// direction (this is the same as the JAMS implementation of a Bloch domain wall
// in the initializer).
//
// The pinned region should be quite far from the domain wall to stop any
// artefacts from the pinning. We also note that because we are using a finite
// system along x, there will be surface effects such as surface magnon modes.
// Again using, a long system along x will minimise the effect of these.
// An alternative used in the literature at anti-periodic boundaries where a
// periodic boundary is used along x but with antiferromagnetic coupling across
// the boundary. In my opinion (without testing) this could do extremely
// strange things to the magnons, especially as thermal magnons propagate
// through the boundary so we're not doing that here.
// See Moreno, Phys. Rev. B 94, 104433 (2016)
// (https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevb.94.104433) for where anti-periodic
// boundaries have been used by others.
//
// NOTE: Currently the "pinned_boundaries" module does not have a CUDA
// implementation and so slows down the GPU solvers A LOT because it must copy
// the spin array from GPU to CPU and back every iteration.
