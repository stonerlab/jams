System
======

The system is defined by the basis vectors of a unit cell. Within
the unit cell multiple atomic positions can be defined (sometimes called a
motif). The unit cell is repeated in space creating a super cell. Periodic
boundary conditions can be toggled along each basis vector direction which
allows the creation of bulk-like, thin-film, wire and particle systems.
